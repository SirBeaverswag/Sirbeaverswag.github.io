        This recepie is my favoite because I have a deep emotional attachment to it. 
        My girlfirend and I have been in a long distance relationship for a while and something we can always do is play games together. 
        We often play games that lack voice acting so we can voice the characers ourselves. 
        One of our favorites was this game called One Shot. 
        The game features the central character, Niko, who loves his mom's hazelnut pancakes.
        Throughout the game he is trying to get back to her. 
        For the game's 5 year anniversary, the developer released a free playable expereince where niko and his friends make the pancakes based on his mom's recepie.
        The recepie could be followed in real life and me and my Girlfriend promised we would make them sometime.
        It took a while, but this past summer we finally made them and they were not only super fun to make but they tasted incredible.
        The whole thing involved making our own syrup and candied hazelnuts for toppings so it was very involved.
        They are delicious and nutty and are now associated with a very nice memory for me.
