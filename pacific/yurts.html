        <h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails!</h2>

        <dt><b>What is a Yurt?</b></dt>
        <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. 
            Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, 
            and a roof dome that can be opened.
        </dd><br>

        <dt><b>How are the yurts furnished?</b></dt>
        <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove. 
            Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold 
            running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.
        </dd><br>

        <dt><b>What should I bring?</b></dt>
        <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing 
            weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight 
            and a sense of adventure!
